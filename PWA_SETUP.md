3. Select "Add to Home Screen" or "Install App"
4. Confirm the installation

### On Desktop (Chrome/Edge):

## Current PWA Features

### ‚úÖ Working Features:
- **Installable**: Can be added to home screen
- **Standalone Mode**: Runs without browser UI
- **Responsive Design**: Works on all screen sizes
- **Touch Optimized**: 44px minimum touch targets
- **Safe Areas**: Handles iPhone notch/Dynamic Island
- **Offline Detection**: Shows when offline
- **App Metadata**: Proper name, description, icons

### üîÑ To Complete:
- **Icons**: Replace placeholder icons with actual app icons
- **Offline Functionality**: Currently shows offline status but doesn't cache content
- **Push Notifications**: Not implemented (optional)

## Next Steps

### 1. Replace Placeholder Icons
The following files need to be replaced with actual PNG images:
- `public/favicon.ico` (32x32)
- `public/apple-touch-icon.png` (180x180)
- `public/pwa-192x192.png` (192x192)
- `public/pwa-512x512.png` (512x512)

You can use tools like:
- [RealFaviconGenerator](https://realfavicongenerator.net/)
- [PWA Builder](https://www.pwabuilder.com/)
- [Favicon.io](https://favicon.io/)

### 2. Test the Installation
1. Start your dev server: `npm run dev`
2. Open the app in a mobile browser
3. Try installing it to your home screen
4. Test that it opens in standalone mode

### 3. Build for Production
```bash
npm run build
```
The built app will have full PWA functionality including service worker.

## Troubleshooting

### Service Worker Error in Development
If you see "SW registration failed" in development, this is normal. The service worker is only fully functional after building the app. You can enable it in development by:

1. The Vite config already includes `devOptions: { enabled: true }`
2. Restart your dev server after making PWA changes

### Icons Not Showing
Make sure to replace the placeholder icon files with actual PNG images of the correct sizes.

### App Not Installing
- Ensure you're using HTTPS (required for PWA)
- Check that all required manifest fields are present
- Verify icons are accessible
